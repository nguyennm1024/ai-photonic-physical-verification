## Fix 1: Tile Click Debug Output ✅

### Problem
User reports tiles are still not clickable - nothing appears in Section 4.

### Solution
Added comprehensive debug output to trace the entire click flow.

**File**: `ui/event_handlers.py` - `handle_tile_click()`

**Debug Output Added**:
```python
def handle_tile_click(self, row: int, col: int):
    print(f"🖱️  Tile clicked: row={row}, col={col}")
    
    # Check grid config
    print(f"📍 Tile index: {tile_index}")
    
    # Check SVG path
    print(f"📄 SVG path: {svg_path}")
    
    # Generate tile
    print(f"🔧 Generating tile on demand...")
    print(f"📦 Tile data received: {tile_data is not None}")
    
    # Process image
    print(f"🖼️  Processing tile image...")
    print(f"   Image size: {image.size}")
    
    # Display
    print(f"✅ Displaying tile in Section 4...")
    print(f"✅ Tile {tile_index} displayed successfully!")
```

**What This Does**:
- Confirms tile click is detected
- Shows which tile was clicked (row, col, index)
- Verifies grid config exists
- Verifies SVG path exists
- Shows tile generation progress
- Shows image processing
- Confirms successful display

**How to Use**:
1. Run `python main.py`
2. Click any tile
3. Watch terminal output to see where it fails
4. Error messages show exactly what's missing

**Example Output**:
```
🖱️  Tile clicked: row=1, col=2
📍 Tile index: 5
📄 SVG path: /path/to/Nexus_Sample2_layout.svg
🔧 Generating tile on demand...
📦 Tile data received: True
🖼️  Processing tile image...
   Image size: (512, 512)
✅ Displaying tile in Section 4...
✅ Tile 5 displayed successfully!
```

## Fix 2: ROI Mode Stays Active ✅

### Problem
Had to click "Select ROIs" button every time to draw a new rectangle.

### Solution
**ROI mode now stays active** after drawing each rectangle!

**File**: `ui/components/image_canvas.py` - `_on_mouse_release()`

**Before**:
```python
def _on_mouse_release(self, event):
    # ... draw rectangle ...
    
    # Reset and EXIT ROI mode ❌
    self.roi_selecting = False  # This exits mode
    self.roi_start = None
```

**After**:
```python
def _on_mouse_release(self, event):
    # ... draw permanent rectangle ...
    self.ax.add_patch(roi_rect)
    self.roi_rectangles.append(roi_rect)
    
    # Call callback
    if self.roi_callback:
        self.roi_callback((x1, y1, x2, y2))
    
    # Reset start point (KEEP selecting mode active!) ✅
    self.roi_start = None  # Only reset start, not the mode!
```

**Result**:
- Click "Select ROIs" button **once**
- Draw rectangle #1 → **Mode stays active** ✅
- Draw rectangle #2 → **Mode stays active** ✅
- Draw rectangle #3 → **Mode stays active** ✅
- Draw as many as you want!
- Click "Select ROIs" again to exit

**Title Update**:
```
"ROI Mode - Draw rectangles | Click to select | Delete key to remove"
```

## Fix 3: Select ROI Boxes by Clicking ✅

### Problem
Could not select drawn ROI boxes for editing/deletion.

### Solution
Click on any drawn ROI rectangle to select it!

**File**: `ui/components/image_canvas.py`

**New Method**: `_find_roi_at_point(x, y)`
```python
def _find_roi_at_point(self, x, y):
    """Find ROI rectangle at the given point"""
    for roi_rect in self.roi_rectangles:
        rect_x = roi_rect.get_x()
        rect_y = roi_rect.get_y()
        rect_width = roi_rect.get_width()
        rect_height = roi_rect.get_height()
        
        # Check if point is inside rectangle
        if (rect_x <= x <= rect_x + rect_width and 
            rect_y <= y <= rect_y + rect_height):
            return roi_rect
    
    return None
```

**New Method**: `_select_roi(roi_rect)`
```python
def _select_roi(self, roi_rect):
    """Select an ROI rectangle (highlight it)"""
    # Deselect previous
    if self.selected_roi_rect is not None:
        self._deselect_roi()
    
    # Highlight the selected ROI
    self.selected_roi_rect = roi_rect
    roi_rect.set_edgecolor('yellow')  # Highlight!
    roi_rect.set_linewidth(3)
    self.canvas.draw()
```

**Updated Mouse Press**:
```python
def _on_mouse_press(self, event):
    click_x, click_y = event.xdata, event.ydata
    
    # Check if clicking on an existing ROI rectangle
    clicked_roi = self._find_roi_at_point(click_x, click_y)
    if clicked_roi is not None:
        self._select_roi(clicked_roi)  # Highlight it!
        return
    
    # Otherwise, handle normal drawing/tile click
    ...
```

**Visual Feedback**:
- **Normal ROI**: Red solid line (2px width)
- **Selected ROI**: Yellow solid line (3px width) ⭐
- **While drawing**: Red dashed line (preview)

**How It Works**:
1. Draw some ROI rectangles (red)
2. Click on any rectangle → Turns yellow ✅
3. Click on different rectangle → Previous deselects, new one highlights ✅
4. Click empty space (in ROI mode) → Start drawing new rectangle

---

## Fix 4: Delete ROIs with Keyboard ✅

### Problem
No way to delete drawn ROI rectangles.

### Solution
Press **Delete** or **Backspace** key to remove selected ROI!

**File**: `ui/components/image_canvas.py`

**New Method**: `_on_key_press(event)`
```python
def _on_key_press(self, event):
    """Handle keyboard events"""
    if event.key == 'delete' or event.key == 'backspace':
        # Delete selected ROI
        if self.selected_roi_rect is not None:
            print(f"🗑️  Deleting selected ROI")
            self.selected_roi_rect.remove()
            self.roi_rectangles.remove(self.selected_roi_rect)
            self.selected_roi_rect = None
            self.canvas.draw()
            print(f"✅ ROI deleted")
```

**Keyboard Binding**:
```python
# In _setup_canvas():
self.canvas.mpl_connect('key_press_event', self._on_key_press)
```

**How to Use**:
1. Click on an ROI rectangle (it turns yellow)
2. Press **Delete** key on keyboard
3. ROI is removed! ✅

**Supported Keys**:
- `Delete` key
- `Backspace` key

3. Drag rectangle #1 → Release (stays in ROI mode) ✅
4. Drag rectangle #2 → Release (still in ROI mode) ✅
5. Drag rectangle #3 → Release (still in ROI mode) ✅
6. ... draw as many as you want!
```

### Step 4: Select & Delete ROIs
```
Click on ROI #2 → Turns yellow (selected)

Click on ROI #1 → Turns yellow
Press Delete key → ROI #1 removed! ✅
```

### Step 5: Exit ROI Mode
```
Click "Select ROIs" button again → Exit ROI mode
Now you can click tiles again!
```

### Step 6: Process
```
"Process All Tiles" → All tiles in grid
OR
"Process Selected Regions" → Only tiles overlapping remaining ROIs
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Tile Click Doesn't Work

**Check Terminal Output**:
```
If you see: "❌ No grid configured"
→ Generate grid first!

If you see: "❌ No SVG path available"  
→ Load GDS file first!

If you see: "❌ Failed to generate tile"
→ Check if rsvg-convert or inkscape is installed
```

**Make Sure**:
- [x] GDS file is loaded
- [x] Grid is generated
- [x] NOT in ROI mode (click "Select ROIs" to toggle off)
- [x] Clicking on the layout image (not outside)

### If ROI Mode Exits After Drawing

**This should NOT happen anymore!** 

If it does:
- Make sure you're using the updated `ui/components/image_canvas.py`
- Check that `_on_mouse_release()` doesn't set `self.roi_selecting = False`

### If Delete Key Doesn't Work

**Make Sure**:
- Canvas has focus (click on layout first)
- An ROI is selected (yellow highlight)
- You're pressing Delete or Backspace (not other keys)
